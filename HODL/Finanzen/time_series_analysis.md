### Definition 
A [statistical method](statistical_learning) for analyzing and modelling data that is *ordered in time*, often
used for forcasting future values based on past observations

---

### Time Series Processes

**Def:** A **mathematical model** that describes how a variable evolves over time

- [Random Walk](random_walk) (non-stationary)
- [Mean Reversion](mean_reversion) (stationary)

---

### Time Series Tests

**Def:** **Statistical procedures** used to assess properties of time series, such as stationarity, 
autocorrelation, or heteroskedasticity

- [ADF Test](adf_test)

---

### Time Series Models

**Def:** **Parametric** or **algorithmic** representations of time series processes, used 
to fit historical data and forecast future values

##### Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Used to model the variations in the absolute value of a time series

##### Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
- Used to model the volatility of time series over time
